## What is this?
`Auth` is a simple and secure example of a REST API implemented using TypeScript with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB. 

## Why is this?
This repository was created to host all of the source code for [a blog post](https://blog.cryptobyte.dev/basic-typescript-express-auth/) that outlines all of this in depth. If you haven't yet I would encourage you to take a look because it provides a really in depth explanation of everything here. This repository will be updated as we build on to this project in future articles as well so [stay tuned](https://blog.cryptobyte.dev/#/portal/) if you want to follow along!

## Can I contribute?
Contributions are encouraged! Feel free to make a pull request with changes that match the intent of the code, for example changes to harden security or clarity of the code base. I will shout out meaningful contributions in future blog posts!
